## :notebook: How It Works

The user types a task into the input field.

Upon clicking Add Task or pressing Enter, the app checks:

- ✅ If the input is not empty, it creates a new task item in the list.

- ❌ If the input is empty, the input field is highlighted in red briefly to indicate an error.

All tasks are saved locally, so they persis after page refreshes.

Each task has:

- A checkbox to mark it as completed.

- A delete icon/button to remove it.

- An edit icon/button to edit it.

- Label linked to the input for accessibility.
